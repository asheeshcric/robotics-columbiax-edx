# Creating a ROS Environment for a new project
# Make sure that your zsh/bash script sources the ROS Kinetic script everytime it starts
source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.zsh

1. Create a catkin workspace.

2. Build the workspace:
	cd catkin_ws
	catkin_make
	
3. Source the devel/setup.zsh file
	source devel/setup.zsh
	
4.  Run 'roscore' in a separate terminal


# Only for Project 2
5. On two separate terminals run the following commands:
	rosrun marker_publisher marker_publisher
	rosrun project2_solution solution.py
	
6. To visualize the markers, launch rviz in a new terminal
	rosrun rviz rviz
	
	
	First thing you need to do is change the Fixed Frame option on the left of the UI. Select "base_frame", and notice that the Global Status now reads "Ok". Now we need to add the information we want to be displayed. Click Add and on the popup screen select the tab "By topic". Here you will see the topic /visualization_marker>Marker. Select it and then you should be able to see the block, cylinder and arrow. You can also add the item "TF" if you want to see a visual representation of the frames.
